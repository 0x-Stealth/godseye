GodsEye is in development. It will be a large kit of tools, some custom, some sourced from throughout the interwebs, for mainly malware development / payload generation, etc.

We will try include most languages.


Credit to user etwhook for NimProxy, a few things in here may be taken from him. 

You NEED the Nim compiler installed (and in path).
We use Python for the main module since Nim's OOP possibility is not ideal.
Yeah yeah, sure it works. Not ideal.
